<h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
<h2>Moby Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks
     like some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel 
     <e>Moby-Dick</e>. We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this class of
     American literature.

    <p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" >Moby-Dick</a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
    <pre>     Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
     to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving 
     off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</pre>
     <p>After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em>be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately
     one jillion pages. The only bigger than Moby(who--<em>spoiler alert!</em>--is a giant whale)is the book itself.</p>
